	abstract = {Exponential growth presented by numerical series or graphs is grossly underestimated by human subjects. This misperception was considerably lessened by presenting decreasing functions; this conclusion holds for both numeric and graphic stimuli. In the numerical conditions, about 25\% of the subjects performed according to the statistical norm. In contrast with previous results, considerable individual differences with respect to sensitivity for rate of growth were observed. This finding was interpreted in terms of task difficulty: Extrapolation of ascending series is too difficult a task to be discriminative. Extrapolation of descending series is much easier, and may therefore better discriminate among subjects.},

	abstract = {Most of our knowledge of the accuracy or goodness of human judgement has been gained from studies carried out in a setting of multivariate non-serially correlated cues. This is not representative of the task of time series forecasting where there is typically a single series of serially correlated cues. As judgement is widely used in this setting, this study seeks to investigate the extent to which some of the widely documented judgemental biases and heuristics apply to time series forecasting. The research design varied the series presentation, series length and the type of series to investigate the influences of presentation scale, length of series, recency and anchoring and adjustment in estimating a judgemental forecast. The time series used were modelled from a stationary ARMA process. The study found that while scale did not influence accuracy, series length and the most recent segment slope did influence it. Subjects' forecasts could be modelled as exponential smoothing or anchoring and adjustment, where the anchor point corresponded to the long term average of the stationary series.},

	abstract = {Graphical representations have to be true to the data they display. Computational tools ensure this on a technical level. But we also need to take ???flaws??? of the human perceptual system into account. The sine illusion provides an example where human perception leads to systematic bias in the assessment of the optical stimulus, with a particularly notable impact on perception of time-series data with a seasonal component. In this article, we discuss the reasons for the illusion and various strategies useful to break the illusion or reduce its strength. We demonstrate the presence of the illusion in real-world and theoretical situations. We also present data from a user study, which demonstrate the dramatic effect the sine illusion can have on conclusions drawn from displayed data.},
