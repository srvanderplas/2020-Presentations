## Rural Shrink-smart Strategies

- Augment rural quality-of-life polls (Iowa and Nebraska) with government data

    - Improve survey strategy
    - Aggregate information over multiple spatial resolutions
    
- Develop (and test) visualizations for towns
    
    - Goal: maintain quality of life for residents even as the town shrinks
    - Make decisions based on successful strategies used in other towns with similar characteristics
    - Provide small towns with useful data and data science resources
