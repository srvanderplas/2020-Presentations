## Breech Face Comparison

- Cartridge impacts the breech face of the gun during the firing process

- Contact between the full cartridge case and the breech face is not guaranteed

- Matching should allow for areas of the cartridge which do not impact the cartridge case

## Split the cartridge case into cells
![](correlation-cells.png)

- Number of cells that "match" indicate the amount of similarity
- Obviously dependent on cell grid size

## Comparison Cell Alignment

Compare each region in image 1 to a larger area in image 2

## What about rotation?

Real scans are not aligned precisely

- Scanned at different rotations
- Firing pin may not line up with breech face alignment

## Comparing Same-source and Different-source scans

Same-source scans will have 
- many cells that have a high cross-correlation
- similar translation values and rotation values for each aligned cell

Declare cells with similar translation and rotation values to be "matching"

Same-source scans should have a high number of matching cells; different-source scans should have a very low number of matching cells
